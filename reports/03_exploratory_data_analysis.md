# Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploring patterns, trends, and distributions in the cleaned dataset.

## Overall Production Trends

- Aggregated production across all crops by year
- Total production trends visualized with line charts
- Observed years with increases/decreases in aggregate production

## Crop-wise Comparison

- Top 6 crops by total production plotted over years
- Identified dominant crops and compared their trajectories

## Distribution Analysis

- Histogram of all production values showed skewness
- Boxplots of top crops highlighted variability and extreme values

## Outliers

- Flagged using z-scores per crop
- Outliers inspected for potential data errors or extreme events

## Correlation Analysis

- Pivoted metrics to wide format (production, volume, value)
- Computed correlation matrix
- Checked relationships between production and export metrics

## Additional Plots

- Stacked area plot: production share by crop
- Year-over-year percent change bar chart
- Rolling 3-year average line chart
- Production vs export value scatter plot
- Violin plots for per-crop distributions

**Interpretation**

- Identified crop-specific variability
- Detected production trends and correlations
- Highlighted years with abnormal growth or decline
